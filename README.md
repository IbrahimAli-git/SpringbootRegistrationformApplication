## Project Descripton
This is my completed project which is based on the coding challenge given. I utilised the technologies mentioned in the pdf to build the final application. This includes a MySQL database titled aeroparker, and a customers table. 
This also includes using springboot to connect the frontend and backend, and for my business logic. I then used Thymelead templates to develop my frontend.
A video presentation of the completed application can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/wDRH3zaVl-Q
